<h3><b>Data Overview</b></h3>

The happiness dataset.csv dataset is obtained from the "World Happiness Report", a report in which the various countries are classified based on their level of happiness. This report is based on the "Gallup World Poll" survey involving more than 100,000 people in 137 countries. This dataset contains a record of the happiness index scores of countries from 2016 to 2022. With a total of 15 columns, it provides an overview of the well-being and life satisfaction of individuals in different countries over a 7-year period. In practice, respondents are asked to rate their current lives on a scale from 0 to 10 and then the average scores are calculated for each country. Furthermore, the following factors are examined: Pro-capite GDP, Life expectation, Social support, Freedom to make life choices, Generosity Perception of corruption. However, it is important to keep in mind that happiness is a subjective measure and the data in this dataset may be influenced by various factors such as cultural differences in what constitutes happiness, survey methodology, and the accuracy of the data collection.

The Mental_Dataset contains informative data from countries across the globe about the prevalence of mental health disorders including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, eating disorders, anxiety disorders, drug use disorders, depression and alcohol use disorders. By providing this data in an easy to visualise format you can gain an insight into how these issues are impacting lives; allowing for a deeper understanding of these conditions and the implications.

v<h3><b>Research question</b></h3>

We want to emphasize the strong positive correlation between the happiness index and the prevalence of mental disorders globally, indicating that as one increases, the other does as well. Countries like New Zealand, Canada, and Ireland consistently rank high on global happiness scales. Simultaneously, these nations exhibit rates of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and eating disorders that exceed the global average. In contrast, countries such as Burundi, Syria, and the Central African Republic, which are at the bottom of happiness rankings, show significantly lower rates of mental disorders.
